            Create a new, public repository and add a blank solution.Add a new Console Application project called Multiples3And5.

            If we list all the natural numbers below 10
            that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5,
            6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

            Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 and print it out to the console.

            Remember to commit changes to the repository.Submit your repo url to this assignment. */
