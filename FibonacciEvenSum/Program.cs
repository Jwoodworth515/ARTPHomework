            Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated
            by adding the previous two terms.By starting with
            1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

            1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

            By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

            Remember to commit changes to the repository. Submit your repo url to this assignment. */
